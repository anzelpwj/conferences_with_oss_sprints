# Conferences with Open Source sprints

Mentored open source sprints are a fantastic way to get involved in the OSS community, but not all conferences do them. Here is a list of conferences that I've found that do offer these.

If you know of any other conferences that have sprints, OSS hackathons, or similar please feel free to create an issue and let me know!
